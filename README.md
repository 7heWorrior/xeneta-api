# Rates API

This project is a Flask-based API for querying shipping rates between ports. It uses PostgreSQL as the database and follows best practices for performance and scalability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rates-api.git
cd rates-api
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate your projectâ€™s dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:
  
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up the Database

Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create the necessary database and tables:

1. Access PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```

2. Create the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE rates_db;
   ```

3. Exit `psql` and load the provided schema:

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d rates_db -f path/to/rates.sql
   ```

Replace `path/to/rates.sql` with the actual path to your `rates.sql` file.

## Running the Application

To start the Flask application, run:

```bash
flask run
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Running Tests

You can run the test suite using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all the unit tests to ensure your application is working as expected.

## Logging

Logging is configured to output to the console by default. You can modify the logging configuration in `app.py` to log to a file if needed.

## Performance Optimization

For performance optimization, consider:

- Using indexing on frequently queried columns.
- Partitioning large tables by date.
- Implementing caching for frequently accessed data.
- Archiving old data to keep tables smaller.

These strategies are discussed in detail in the project documentation.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /rates**: Retrieve average shipping rates between ports over a specified date range.

  Example request:

  ```bash
  curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/rates?date_from=2016-01-01&date_to=2016-01-10&origin=CNSGH&destination=north_europe_main"
  ```

  Example response:

  ```json
  [
      {
          "day": "2016-01-01",
          "average_price": 1150
      },
      {
          "day": "2016-01-02",
          "average_price": null
      }
  ]
  ```
